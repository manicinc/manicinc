# SEOStory — AI-Powered SEO Enhancement Toolkit

Published November 4, 2025.

SEOStory is our agency’s own AI-assisted workflow for technical SEO, content refreshes, and reporting. In under three months we moved the query “Manic Agency” from position **#13** to **#2** without sacrificing voice or over-optimizing copy. The playbook now lives at [seostory.xyz](https://seostory.xyz) so other teams can borrow what worked for us.

## Why we built it

As our project roster expanded, manual audits and content rewrites fell behind. We needed a repeatable system that:
- Keeps messaging true to the brand while filling keyword gaps.
- Understands site architecture, redirects, and dynamic routes across Next.js builds.
- Produces reports clients actually read.
- Ships fast enough to react to algorithm updates.

SEOStory glues together crawling, AI-driven rewrites, schema generation, and visual reporting into one daily command.

## Core capabilities

- **Full-site reconnaissance** — Smart crawl of routes, metadata, and internal links tailored for modern frameworks.
- **Voice-preserving rewrites** — GPT/Claude prompts tuned to respect tone, legal language, and character limits.
- **Opportunity mapping** — Automatic clustering of related pages with suggested anchor text for internal links.
- **Asset optimization** — Image checks, structured data snippets, and alt-text recommendations in one sweep.
- **Shareable storyboards** — HTML and JSON reports with traffic snapshots, keyword deltas, and prioritized next moves.

## The “rank #13 → #2” workflow

1. **Baseline audit** highlighted missing schema and thin copy on our services pages.
2. **AI-assisted refresh** rewrote ~20% of the text, weaving in branded long-tail keywords without wrecking tone.
3. **Internal link pass** strengthened authority from high-performing blog posts.
4. **Weekly diff reviews** in Git kept humans in control while AI handled heavy lifting.
5. **Narrative reporting** gave stakeholders a story, not a spreadsheet, so follow-up actions actually shipped.

## Designed for agencies & in-house teams

- Fast onboarding—drop the CLI into an existing Next.js/React repo.
- Works offline with your own API keys; data never leaves your environment.
- Optional GitHub Action opens pull requests with proposed changes.
- Clear licensing for solo practitioners, studios, and enterprise teams.
