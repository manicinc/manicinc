## What is DomainHQ?

DomainHQ is an **AI-powered domain sales intelligence platform** that transforms how investors, brokers, and businesses approach domain acquisitions. Instead of guessing based on gut instinct, you get data-driven valuations backed by **100,000+ historical sales** and real-time market intelligence.

The domain aftermarket is a **$4+ billion industry** where pricing remains remarkably opaque. Traditional appraisal tools rely on outdated algorithms and ignore crucial context like brand sentiment, SEO value, and comparable sales patterns. DomainHQ changes that.

## The Problem We Solve

Domain investing without data is gambling. Here's what most investors face:

- **Fragmented Data** — Sales scattered across 15+ marketplaces with no unified view
- **Inaccurate Appraisals** — GoDaddy inflates values; Estibot uses decade-old algorithms
- **No Comparables** — Finding similar domain sales requires hours of manual research
- **Missed Deals** — By the time you spot a good auction, it's already over
- **Gut-Based Pricing** — Sellers ask arbitrary prices; buyers have no negotiation data

DomainHQ solves all of this with AI.

## Core Features

### 💰 AI Valuations with Comparables

Our valuation engine doesn't just spit out a number—it shows its work.

- **Multi-Factor Analysis** — 50+ signals including TLD, length, keywords, brandability
- **Historical Comparables** — See what similar domains actually sold for
- **Confidence Scoring** — Know when data is sparse vs. robust
- **Low/Mid/High Ranges** — Understand the negotiation envelope

**94%+ accuracy** against realized sales in our validation dataset.

### 📊 Multi-Source Data Aggregation

We scrape so you don't have to. Real-time data from:

| Platform | Data Type |
|----------|-----------|
| GoDaddy Auctions | Live auctions, expired domains |
| NameJet | Premium auction inventory |
| Sedo | European marketplace data |
| Dynadot | Direct sales, marketplace |
| Afternic | BIN listings, premium inventory |
| NameBio | Historical sales database |
| + 10 more | Specialized TLD registries |

All normalized, deduplicated, and searchable in one interface.

### 🎯 Deal Scoring Algorithm

Every domain gets a **0-100 Deal Score** based on:

- **Value Gap** — How far below AI valuation is the asking price?
- **Comparable Volume** — Do we have strong evidence for the valuation?
- **Market Momentum** — Is this TLD/niche trending up or down?
- **Liquidity Risk** — How long do similar domains take to sell?

High scores surface automatically. Stop scrolling through garbage.

### 📡 Live Auction Tracking

Never miss another deal.

- **Real-Time Bid Monitoring** — See bids as they happen
- **Ending Soon Alerts** — Push notifications for expiring auctions
- **Snipe Detection** — Know when last-second bidders are active
- **Historical Bid Patterns** — Learn when to bid and when to wait

### 🧠 AI Domain Brainstorming

Need domains? Let AI help.

- **Style Preferences** — Brandable, keyword-rich, short, descriptive
- **Industry Targeting** — Generate for specific verticals
- **Availability Checking** — Instant WHOIS lookups
- **Trademark Screening** — Avoid legal landmines

### 📈 Historical Sales Database

**100,000+ verified sales** with full metadata:

- Domain name and TLD
- Sale price (normalized to USD)
- Venue and date

- Domain age at time of sale

Filter, sort, export. Build your own analysis.

## The AI Advantage

Traditional domain appraisals fail because they ignore context. Our AI model considers:

1. **Semantic Meaning** — "cloudbank.ai" isn't just 9 letters; it's two powerful keywords
2. **Category Detection** — Automatically classify domains into 50+ industry verticals
3. **TLD Intelligence** — .ai premiums differ from .io premiums
4. **Market Timing** — What's hot in 2026 isn't what was hot in 2020
5. **Brandability Scoring** — Pronounceable, memorable, defensible

This isn't simple string matching. It's genuine natural language understanding applied to the domain aftermarket.

## Why We Built DomainHQ

Domain investing was our accidental side hustle. We kept buying domains on gut instinct, overpaying for some, missing obvious deals on others. The existing tools felt stuck in 2015.

So we built what we wished existed:

- A single place to see all marketplace data
- Valuations that actually correlate with realized sales
- Alerts that surface deals before they expire
- AI that generates brandable options when we're stuck

We've been using DomainHQ internally for 18 months. Now it's ready for everyone.
