/* ==========================================================================
   Minimal Base Styles
   - Most base HTML/typography styles are now consolidated in theme.css.
   - This file can be used for truly global, non-theme-specific base settings
     or utilities if needed, but is currently minimal.
   ========================================================================== */

/* --- Theme Transition Class --- */
/* This class is added to <html> via JavaScript during theme switching
   to temporarily enable transitions on theme-related properties.
   (Style definition also exists in theme.css for consolidation,
    can be removed from here if theme.css is always imported after base.css) */
/* html.theme-transitioning *,
html.theme-transitioning *::before,
html.theme-transitioning *::after {
  transition: var(--transition-theme) !important;
} */

/* --- Post Content Base --- */
/* Base class for main content areas like blog posts.
   (Style definition also exists in theme.css for consolidation,
    can be removed from here if theme.css is always imported after base.css) */
/* .post-content {
  transition: font-size 0.2s ease-out;
} */

/* --- Other Base Styles (If Any) --- */
/* Add any other non-theme-specific base styles here if necessary. */
/* For example, specific resets not covered by Tailwind's preflight. */
